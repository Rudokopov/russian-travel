          According to wciom polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere,
          but only 36% plan to spend their holidays in their native country.
          Like, what have we not seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole
          universe with the gentle sea of ​the south, the dense forests of the
          Sayans and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. And you can see all
          these beauties without millions in your account, a passport and many
          hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young
          mother who took three children in her arms, put them in her Zhiguli
          and drove 20 thousand kilometers through her native country. We have
          selected and described several interesting places worthy of your
          vacation.

              Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all
              from behind the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see
              slopes strewn pines, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open it
              in the car windows, you can get acquainted with the invisible
              miracle of the places here - mountain air.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in the
              summer. This way you will see all the diversity of local flora and
              fauna. Elks roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges,
              and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also
              inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

              Everyone knows Baykal as the largest lake in the world. Many also
              know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one of the
              most beautiful places in Russia.
            </p>
            <p class="place__paragraph">
              Of course, it's all like that. But Baykal is still an ideal place
              for skoyoring competitions. This is a sport when a skier ties
              himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much
              speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record of
              197.011 km/h was set at the Baikal Mile festival.
